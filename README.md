# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, also known as Noughts and Crosses. The game is played between two players on a 3x3 grid, where one player takes the role of "X" and the other takes the role of "O". Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty cell in the grid, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row â€” either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

# Features
#### Two-player Mode: Play against a friend locally, taking turns on the same device.
#### Win Detection: Automatically detects when a player has won by forming a line of three symbols in any direction.
#### Draw Detection: Ends the game if the grid is filled without any winning combinations.
#### Responsive UI: The game grid adjusts to fit various screen sizes and devices.

# How to Play
Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol (X or O).</br>
The game continues until one player wins by placing three symbols in a row or until there are no more empty cells left, resulting in a draw.</br>
The game will announce the winner or declare a draw when the game ends.
